\typeout{
*
Lemma — a minor result whose sole purpose is to help in proving a theorem.  It is a stepping stone on the path to proving a theorem. Very occasionally lemmas can take on a life of their own (Zorn’s lemma, Urysohn’s lemma, Burnside’s lemma, Sperner’s lemma).
*
Proposition — a proved and often interesting result, but generally less important than a theorem.
*
Claim — an assertion that is then proved.  It is often used like an informal lemma.

Even pages, left --- odd pages, right.
