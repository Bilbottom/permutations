standard theorems, such as:
    odd perms always odd (resp even)
    conjugation notation (\alpha^{-1}\sigma\alpha is just \alpha applied to each element of sigma individually). Why is conjugation important?
    every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles


standard permutation groups, such as S_n and A_n.

applications to other branches of maths.

why are permutations important? Hint: aptly called _symmetric groups_! That is, symmetry groups of shapes!

Have plenty of exercises --- use group theory ones (such as generating A_{n}) and Brighton coursework questions.

Not uncommon to see (2, 2, 3) etc to denote a 2-2-3-cycle like (1  2)(3  4)(5  6  7) and so on.

\sigma\gamma = 1 iff \gamma\sigma = 1?

Representation of permutations (2-line arrays, cycles, bipartite graphs),           ✔
inverses,
involutions,                                    (a function that is its own inverse) involutions of S_n are all order 2 elements
parity of permutations,
sign of permutations,
transpositions,
elementary transpositions,
inversions,                                     (as in graph theory)
braid relation,                                 http://www.cmis.brighton.ac.uk/users/agf/FinalBraidCrypto/TutorialOverview.htm
puzzles such as the 15-Puzzle etc.
